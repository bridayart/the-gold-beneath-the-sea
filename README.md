# the-gold-beneath-the-sea
This game was created for a week-long game design challenge in Unity.

I spent a short week creating this game, from ideation to completion, based on specific project criteria.
The game needed to be a puzzle game with an answer key that fit an undersea theme with a play time no longer than five minute.
